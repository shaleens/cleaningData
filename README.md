cleaningData
============


Please run the code in the folder where the directory for the original dataset, viz. UCI HAR dataset is kept.

To get the script to work, change the working directory to the folder in which run_analysis.R and the aforementioned data is present, 
and then source it inside the R console. It will generate the two tidy data set tables, in the txt format.
